## Notes

- Specification is complete and ready for `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`
- 4 user stories covering component authoring, Next.js integration, documentation, and CI enforcement
- Approach analysis recommends centralized registry with lazy registration
- Key deliverables: DSElement base class, component registry, @ds/next loader, enforcement tooling
