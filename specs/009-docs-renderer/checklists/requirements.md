# Specification Quality Checklist: Docs Renderer v1 (Next.js) + White-Label Overlay Workflow

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-01-03
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Spec builds on existing `@ds/docs-core` infrastructure (edition filtering, navigation generation, manifest validation)
- Existing `@ds/docs-renderer-next` package provides foundation - this feature extends it
- Search functionality (US5) is a stub/strategy definition, not full implementation
- Tenant overlay example will demonstrate the workflow without requiring real multi-tenant setup
