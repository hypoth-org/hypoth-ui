# Specification Quality Checklist: White-Label Design System Monorepo

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-01-01
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Approach Analysis

- [x] Minimum 2 approaches documented (3 provided)
- [x] Evaluation criteria align with constitution principles
- [x] Pros/cons are concrete with evidence
- [x] Recommendation is justified against criteria
- [x] Trade-offs are acknowledged

## Notes

- All checklist items pass
- Spec is ready for `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`
- No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present - all requirements are specified with reasonable defaults based on constitution principles
