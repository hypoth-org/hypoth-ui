# Stepper

Step-by-step progress indicator for multi-step processes

## Usage

### Web Component

```html
<ds-stepper>Content</ds-stepper>
```

### React

```tsx
import { Stepper } from "@ds/react";

function Example() {
  return <Stepper>Content</Stepper>;
}
```

## Props

| Prop | Type | Default | Description |
|------|------|---------|-------------|
| `children` | `ReactNode` | - | Content to display |

## Accessibility

- **Keyboard**: Tab, Enter, Space
- **ARIA**: role=list, role=listitem, aria-current=step, aria-label
- **Screen reader**: Uses role=list with accessible label describing the progress steps. Each step item is a list item with active step indicated by aria-current=step. Completed and pending states are conveyed through data attributes.

## Best Practices

### Do

- Follow component-specific guidelines from the design system
- Use semantic markup when possible
- Test with keyboard navigation

### Don't

- Avoid using non-semantic elements where semantic ones exist
- Don't override core accessibility features
- Don't use this component outside its intended context
