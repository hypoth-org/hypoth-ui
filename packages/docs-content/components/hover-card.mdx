# Hover Card

Preview card that appears on hover with configurable delays

## Usage

### Web Component

```html
<ds-hover-card>Content</ds-hover-card>
```

### React

```tsx
import { HoverCard } from "@ds/react";

function Example() {
  return <HoverCard>Content</HoverCard>;
}
```

## Props

| Prop | Type | Default | Description |
|------|------|---------|-------------|
| `children` | `ReactNode` | - | Content to display |

## Accessibility

- **Keyboard**: Escape
- **ARIA**: aria-haspopup, aria-expanded, aria-controls
- **Screen reader**: Trigger has aria-haspopup and aria-expanded. Opens on focus for keyboard users. Content is accessible while open. Escape dismisses the card. Non-modal - doesn't trap focus.

## Best Practices

### Do

- Follow component-specific guidelines from the design system
- Use semantic markup when possible
- Test with keyboard navigation

### Don't

- Avoid using non-semantic elements where semantic ones exist
- Don't override core accessibility features
- Don't use this component outside its intended context
