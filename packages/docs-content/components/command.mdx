# Command

Command palette with fuzzy search, keyboard navigation, and grouping

## Usage

### Web Component

```html
<ds-command>Content</ds-command>
```

### React

```tsx
import { Command } from "@ds/react";

function Example() {
  return <Command>Content</Command>;
}
```

## Props

| Prop | Type | Default | Description |
|------|------|---------|-------------|
| `children` | `ReactNode` | - | Content to display |

## Accessibility

- **Keyboard**: ArrowUp, ArrowDown, Enter, Escape, Home, End
- **ARIA**: role=search, role=listbox, role=option, aria-label, aria-selected
- **Screen reader**: Root container uses role=search with accessible label. Input announces as a combobox. Items are navigable with arrow keys and announced with their text. Empty state is announced when no results match.

## Best Practices

### Do

- Follow component-specific guidelines from the design system
- Use semantic markup when possible
- Test with keyboard navigation

### Don't

- Avoid using non-semantic elements where semantic ones exist
- Don't override core accessibility features
- Don't use this component outside its intended context
