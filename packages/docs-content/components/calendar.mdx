# Calendar

Calendar widget for date selection

## Usage

### Web Component

```html
<ds-calendar>Content</ds-calendar>
```

### React

```tsx
import { Calendar } from "@ds/react";

function Example() {
  return <Calendar>Content</Calendar>;
}
```

## Props

| Prop | Type | Default | Description |
|------|------|---------|-------------|
| `children` | `ReactNode` | - | Content to display |

## Accessibility

- **Keyboard**: ArrowLeft, ArrowRight, ArrowUp, ArrowDown, Enter, Space, Home, End, PageUp, PageDown
- **ARIA**: role=application, role=grid, role=gridcell, role=columnheader, aria-selected, aria-disabled, aria-live=polite
- **Screen reader**: Announces as an application with 'Calendar' label. Month/year heading uses aria-live for navigation changes. Day cells use role=gridcell with aria-selected state. Disabled dates announce as disabled.

## Best Practices

### Do

- Follow component-specific guidelines from the design system
- Use semantic markup when possible
- Test with keyboard navigation

### Don't

- Avoid using non-semantic elements where semantic ones exist
- Don't override core accessibility features
- Don't use this component outside its intended context
