# Button

Buttons allow users to trigger actions or events with a single tap or click.

## Usage

Import the button component and use it in your templates:

```html
<ds-button variant="primary">Click me</ds-button>
```

### React

```tsx
import { Button } from "@ds/react";

function MyComponent() {
  return <Button variant="primary" onClick={() => console.log("clicked")}>Click me</Button>;
}
```

## Variants

The button supports several visual variants to communicate different levels of emphasis:

### Primary

Use primary buttons for the main action on a page or in a form.

```html
<ds-button variant="primary">Save changes</ds-button>
```

### Secondary

Use secondary buttons for supporting actions.

```html
<ds-button variant="secondary">Cancel</ds-button>
```

### Ghost

Use ghost buttons for tertiary actions or within dense interfaces.

```html
<ds-button variant="ghost">Learn more</ds-button>
```

### Destructive

Use destructive buttons for actions that delete or remove data.

```html
<ds-button variant="destructive">Delete</ds-button>
```

## Sizes

Buttons come in three sizes:

```html
<ds-button size="sm">Small</ds-button>
<ds-button size="md">Medium</ds-button>
<ds-button size="lg">Large</ds-button>
```

## States

### Loading

Show a loading state while an action is being processed:

```html
<ds-button loading>Saving...</ds-button>
```

### Disabled

Disable the button when the action is not available:

```html
<ds-button disabled>Not available</ds-button>
```

## Accessibility

- Buttons use native `<button>` semantics via Light DOM rendering
- Keyboard support: `Enter` and `Space` activate the button
- Focus is clearly visible with a focus ring
- Loading state announces via `aria-busy`
- Disabled state is communicated via native `disabled` attribute

## Best Practices

### Do

- Use clear, action-oriented labels ("Save", "Delete", "Submit")
- Provide only one primary button per section
- Consider loading states for async actions
- Place the primary action on the right in button groups

### Don't

- Don't use buttons for navigation (use links instead)
- Don't disable buttons without providing context
- Don't use too many primary buttons together
- Don't use vague labels like "Click here" or "Submit"
