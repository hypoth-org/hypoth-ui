# Accordion

Vertically stacked expandable sections for organizing dense content

## Usage

### Web Component

```html
<ds-accordion>Content</ds-accordion>
```

### React

```tsx
import { Accordion } from "@ds/react";

function Example() {
  return <Accordion>Content</Accordion>;
}
```

## Props

| Prop | Type | Default | Description |
|------|------|---------|-------------|
| `children` | `ReactNode` | - | Content to display |

## Accessibility

- **Keyboard**: Enter, Space, ArrowUp, ArrowDown, Home, End
- **ARIA**: aria-expanded, aria-controls, aria-labelledby, role=region
- **Screen reader**: Announces accordion headers with expanded/collapsed state. Each trigger is announced as a button with its heading text and aria-expanded state. Content regions are labeled by their associated headers.

## Best Practices

### Do

- Follow component-specific guidelines from the design system
- Use semantic markup when possible
- Test with keyboard navigation

### Don't

- Avoid using non-semantic elements where semantic ones exist
- Don't override core accessibility features
- Don't use this component outside its intended context
