# Badge

Status indicator with variants and dot mode

## Usage

### Web Component

```html
<ds-badge>Content</ds-badge>
```

### React

```tsx
import { Badge } from "@ds/react";

function Example() {
  return <Badge>Content</Badge>;
}
```

## Props

| Prop | Type | Default | Description |
|------|------|---------|-------------|
| `children` | `ReactNode` | - | Content to display |

## Accessibility

- **Keyboard**: N/A (non-interactive)
- **ARIA**: role=status, aria-label
- **Screen reader**: Announces as a status element. Dot badges announce as 'Notification indicator'. Count badges announce the count with context (e.g., '5 notifications'). Max overflow is announced (e.g., '99+ notifications').

## Best Practices

### Do

- Follow component-specific guidelines from the design system
- Use semantic markup when possible
- Test with keyboard navigation

### Don't

- Avoid using non-semantic elements where semantic ones exist
- Don't override core accessibility features
- Don't use this component outside its intended context
