# Breadcrumb

Navigation trail showing current location in hierarchy

## Usage

### Web Component

```html
<ds-breadcrumb>Content</ds-breadcrumb>
```

### React

```tsx
import { Breadcrumb } from "@ds/react";

function Example() {
  return <Breadcrumb>Content</Breadcrumb>;
}
```

## Props

| Prop | Type | Default | Description |
|------|------|---------|-------------|
| `children` | `ReactNode` | - | Content to display |

## Accessibility

- **Keyboard**: Tab, Enter
- **ARIA**: role=navigation, aria-label=Breadcrumb, aria-current=page
- **Screen reader**: Announces as navigation with 'Breadcrumb' label. Current page is indicated with aria-current='page'. Links are navigable via keyboard. Separator elements are hidden from assistive technology.

## Best Practices

### Do

- Follow component-specific guidelines from the design system
- Use semantic markup when possible
- Test with keyboard navigation

### Don't

- Avoid using non-semantic elements where semantic ones exist
- Don't override core accessibility features
- Don't use this component outside its intended context
