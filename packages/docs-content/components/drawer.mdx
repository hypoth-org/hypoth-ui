# Drawer

Mobile-friendly slide-in panel with swipe-to-dismiss

## Usage

### Web Component

```html
<ds-drawer>Content</ds-drawer>
```

### React

```tsx
import { Drawer } from "@ds/react";

function Example() {
  return <Drawer>Content</Drawer>;
}
```

## Props

| Prop | Type | Default | Description |
|------|------|---------|-------------|
| `children` | `ReactNode` | - | Content to display |

## Accessibility

- **Keyboard**: Tab, Shift+Tab, Escape
- **ARIA**: role=dialog, aria-modal, aria-labelledby, aria-describedby
- **Screen reader**: Announces as a dialog with role=dialog and aria-modal. Title is linked via aria-labelledby. Description via aria-describedby. Focus is trapped within drawer. Focus returns to trigger on close.

## Best Practices

### Do

- Follow component-specific guidelines from the design system
- Use semantic markup when possible
- Test with keyboard navigation

### Don't

- Avoid using non-semantic elements where semantic ones exist
- Don't override core accessibility features
- Don't use this component outside its intended context
