# Scroll Area

Custom scrollbar container with multiple visibility modes

## Usage

### Web Component

```html
<ds-scroll-area>Content</ds-scroll-area>
```

### React

```tsx
import { ScrollArea } from "@ds/react";

function Example() {
  return <ScrollArea>Content</ScrollArea>;
}
```

## Props

| Prop | Type | Default | Description |
|------|------|---------|-------------|
| `children` | `ReactNode` | - | Content to display |

## Accessibility

- **Keyboard**: ArrowUp, ArrowDown, ArrowLeft, ArrowRight, PageUp, PageDown, Home, End, Space
- **ARIA**: 
- **Screen reader**: Native scroll behavior is preserved. Content remains accessible. Custom scrollbars do not interfere with assistive technology. Focus management within scrollable area works as expected.

## Best Practices

### Do

- Follow component-specific guidelines from the design system
- Use semantic markup when possible
- Test with keyboard navigation

### Don't

- Avoid using non-semantic elements where semantic ones exist
- Don't override core accessibility features
- Don't use this component outside its intended context
