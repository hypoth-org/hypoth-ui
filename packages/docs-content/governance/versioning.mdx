# Versioning Policy

This document describes the semantic versioning practices used across all `@ds/*` packages.

## Semantic Versioning

We follow [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](https://semver.org/) with these conventions:

| Version Bump | When to Use | Example Changes |
|--------------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Major** (X.0.0) | Breaking changes | Removed props, renamed components, API changes |
| **Minor** (0.X.0) | New features (backwards compatible) | New components, new props, new utilities |
| **Patch** (0.0.X) | Bug fixes (backwards compatible) | Bug fixes, performance improvements, docs |

## Fixed Versioning

All `@ds/*` packages share the same version number. When any package has a change, all packages are released together with the same version. This simplifies:

- Dependency management for consumers
- Compatibility guarantees between packages
- Release communication

## Changeset Format

We use [Changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets) for version management. Each PR that affects published packages should include a changeset.

### Creating a Changeset

```bash
pnpm changeset
```

This creates a markdown file in `.changeset/` describing your change.

### Extended Metadata

Our changesets support additional metadata for edition filtering and security tracking:

```markdown
---
"@ds/wc": minor
editions: [core, pro, enterprise]
security: false
---

Added new Button variant for icon-only buttons
```

#### Metadata Fields

| Field | Description | Default |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| `editions` | Which editions include this change | All editions |
| `security` | Whether this is a security fix | `false` |
| `breaking_type` | Type of breaking change (for majors) | - |
| `migration_required` | Whether migration steps are needed | `false` |

### Edition Values

- `core` - Core edition (basic components)
- `pro` - Pro edition (core + advanced features)
- `enterprise` - Enterprise edition (all features)

## Breaking Changes

When making breaking changes:

1. **Document the change** - Clearly explain what changed and why
2. **Provide migration path** - Include before/after code examples
3. **Use deprecation first** - When possible, deprecate before removing

### Breaking Change Types

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `api-change` | Component props or API signature changed |
| `removal` | Component, prop, or feature removed |
| `behavior-change` | Existing behavior changed significantly |
| `dependency` | Major dependency update affecting consumers |

## Changelog Format

We follow [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/) format:

- **Security** - Vulnerability fixes (apply immediately)
- **Breaking Changes** - Changes requiring migration
- **Added** - New features
- **Fixed** - Bug fixes
- **Deprecated** - Features marked for removal

### Priority Indicators

Changelog entries include priority markers:

- `**[SECURITY]**` - Security fix, update immediately
- `**[BREAKING]**` - Breaking change, review before updating

## Edition-Specific Changelogs

Tenants can view changelogs filtered by their edition. If a change only affects Pro and Enterprise editions, Core tenants won't see it in their changelog view.

Example changelog entry for Pro-only feature:

```markdown
- Added advanced data grid sorting _(Pro, Enterprise only)_
```

## Release Cadence

| Release Type | Frequency | Contents |
|--------------|-----------|----------|
| Patch | As needed | Bug fixes, security patches |
| Minor | Bi-weekly | New features, improvements |
| Major | Quarterly (max) | Breaking changes |

## Version Support

We support the current major version and one previous major version with security fixes.

| Version | Status | Security Fixes |
|---------|--------|----------------|
| 2.x | Current | Yes |
| 1.x | Previous | Security only |
| 0.x | End of life | No |

## Checking Your Version

```bash
# Check installed version
pnpm list @ds/wc

# Check for updates
pnpm outdated @ds/wc
```
