# Deprecation Policy

We follow a structured deprecation process to give consumers time to migrate away from deprecated features.

## Two Major Version Window

When we deprecate a feature, it remains available for **2 major versions** before removal:

```
Version 1.0 → Feature deprecated (warning)
Version 2.0 → Feature still works (removal warning)
Version 3.0 → Feature removed
```

This gives teams approximately 6+ months to migrate, based on our quarterly major release cadence.

## Deprecation Types

| Type | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| `component` | Entire component deprecated | `OldButton` → `Button` |
| `prop` | Component prop deprecated | `isDisabled` → `disabled` |
| `css-variable` | Design token deprecated | `--ds-primary` → `--ds-color-brand` |
| `utility` | Utility function deprecated | `formatDate` → `dateFormatter` |
| `pattern` | Usage pattern deprecated | Class-based → Hook-based |

## Deprecation Notices

### Console Warnings

Deprecated features log warnings in development:

```
[WARN] Component "OldButton" is deprecated since version 1.0.0.
       Will be removed in version 3.0.0 (2 major versions remaining).
       Action: Use "Button" instead.
       Docs: /governance/migrations/1-to-3
```

### TypeScript

Deprecated items include JSDoc `@deprecated` tags:

```typescript
/**
 * @deprecated Since 1.0.0. Will be removed in 3.0.0. Use `Button` instead.
 */
export const OldButton = ...
```

### Build Warnings

Our build tools can be configured to warn on deprecated feature usage.

## Finding Deprecations

### List All Deprecations

```bash
# Using the CLI
pnpm ds-deprecate list

# Filter by status
pnpm ds-deprecate list --status removal-imminent

# Filter by type
pnpm ds-deprecate list --type component
```

### Check Upcoming Removals

```bash
# Check what will be removed in next major version
pnpm ds-deprecate check 2.0.0
```

### Generate Report

```bash
pnpm ds-deprecate report --current-version 1.5.0
```

## Migration Guides

Each deprecation includes a migration guide explaining:

1. **What changed** - The deprecated feature and its replacement
2. **Why it changed** - Reason for the deprecation
3. **How to migrate** - Step-by-step migration instructions
4. **Code examples** - Before/after code samples

### Generate Migration Guide

```bash
# Generate migration guide between versions
pnpm ds-deprecate migrate 1.0.0 3.0.0
```

## Edition-Specific Deprecations

Some deprecations only affect certain editions:

```json
{
  "item": "AdvancedGrid",
  "type": "component",
  "editions": ["pro", "enterprise"],
  "deprecated_in": "1.0.0",
  "removal_version": "3.0.0"
}
```

Core edition users won't see warnings for Pro/Enterprise-only deprecations.

## Timeline Example

| Date | Version | Status | Action Required |
|------|---------|--------|-----------------|
| Jan 2025 | 1.0.0 | Deprecated | Plan migration |
| Apr 2025 | 2.0.0 | Warning | Begin migration |
| Jul 2025 | 3.0.0 | Removed | Migration complete |

## Best Practices

### For Consumers

1. **Address warnings promptly** - Don't wait until removal
2. **Test migrations early** - Use pre-release versions
3. **Subscribe to releases** - Stay informed of deprecations

### For Contributors

1. **Always provide replacement** - When possible, offer an alternative
2. **Document the reason** - Explain why the deprecation is necessary
3. **Include migration steps** - Make migration as easy as possible
