# Contributing to the Design System

This guide covers the requirements and quality gates for contributing to the design system.

## Contribution Gates

All contributions must pass our quality gates before merging. These gates ensure consistency, accessibility, and maintainability.

### Automated Gates (Required)

These gates run automatically on every PR:

| Gate | Description | Threshold |
|------|-------------|-----------|
| **Test Coverage** | Unit test coverage | 80% minimum |
| **Accessibility** | Automated a11y tests | All tests pass |
| **TypeScript** | Type checking | No errors |
| **Lint** | Code style | No errors |
| **Manifest Validation** | Component manifests | All valid |
| **Docs Presence** | Documentation exists | Required for new components |
| **Changeset** | Version tracking | Required for source changes |

### Manual Gates (When Applicable)

These gates require human review:

| Gate | Description | When Required |
|------|-------------|---------------|
| **Design Review** | Design team approval | New components, visual changes |
| **A11y Audit** | Full accessibility review | New interactive components |

## Running Gates Locally

Before submitting a PR, run gates locally:

```bash
# Run all gates
pnpm ds-check-gates

# Run specific gates
pnpm ds-check-gates --gate typecheck --gate lint

# Run in parallel
pnpm ds-check-gates --parallel
```

### Gate Status

```bash
# Check gate status
pnpm ds-check-gates status

# List available gates
pnpm ds-check-gates list
```

## Test Coverage Requirements

All new code must have at least 80% test coverage:

```bash
# Run tests with coverage
pnpm test:coverage

# Check coverage for specific package
pnpm --filter @ds/wc test:coverage
```

### What Counts Toward Coverage

- Unit tests (`*.test.ts`)
- Component tests
- Integration tests

### What Doesn't Count

- Type definitions
- Re-exports
- Configuration files

## Changeset Requirements

Every PR that modifies source code must include a changeset:

```bash
# Create a changeset
pnpm changeset
```

### Extended Metadata

Include additional metadata for edition filtering:

```markdown
---
"@ds/wc": minor
editions: [pro, enterprise]
security: false
---

Added new DataGrid component for advanced data display
```

### When Changesets Are Not Required

- Documentation-only changes
- Test-only changes
- CI/tooling changes
- Non-published packages

## Component Requirements

New components must include:

### 1. Implementation

```
packages/wc/src/components/my-component/
├── my-component.ts      # Component implementation
├── my-component.css     # Component styles
├── my-component.test.ts # Unit tests
└── index.ts             # Exports
```

### 2. Manifest

```
packages/docs-content/manifests/my-component.json
```

### 3. Documentation

```
packages/docs-content/components/my-component.mdx
```

### 4. Accessibility

- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- Keyboard navigation
- Screen reader support
- Focus management

## Pull Request Process

1. **Create Branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/my-feature
   ```

2. **Make Changes**
   - Follow code style guidelines
   - Add tests
   - Update documentation

3. **Run Gates**
   ```bash
   pnpm ds-check-gates
   ```

4. **Create Changeset**
   ```bash
   pnpm changeset
   ```

5. **Submit PR**
   - Fill out PR template
   - Link related issues
   - Request reviews

6. **Address Feedback**
   - Respond to review comments
   - Push updates
   - Gates will re-run automatically

## Edition Considerations

When contributing features that are edition-specific:

- **Core Edition**: Available to all users
- **Pro Edition**: Advanced features
- **Enterprise Edition**: Full feature set

Specify editions in your changeset:

```markdown
editions: [pro, enterprise]
```

## Getting Help

- **Questions**: Open a discussion
- **Bug Reports**: Create an issue
- **Feature Requests**: Create an RFC
